# Third-party code

## vecx 6809 core (GPL-3.0)

`core/e6809.c` and `core/e6809.h` are the MC6809 emulator from vecx, the
Vectrex emulator by Valavan Manohararajah, as maintained at
https://github.com/jhawthorn/vecx. vecx is distributed under the GNU General
Public License version 3; the full text is in `LICENSES/GPL-3.0.txt`.

Modifications made here: bus accessors and the interrupt line can be supplied
as macros by the including file so they inline; a chunked `e6809_run()` with a
per-instruction break check; a program counter accessor; the `ea` variable is
initialized. Both CPUs of the Star Wars board are instances of this core.

## MAME (BSD-3-Clause)

The following are ports to plain C of code from MAME, https://www.mamedev.org,
used under the BSD-3-Clause license:

* `core/avg.c`: the Atari Analog Vector Generator state machine and the Star
  Wars color/intensity handling, from `src/devices/video/avgdvg.cpp`
  (copyright Mathis Rosenhauer, Eric Smith and the MAME team).
* `core/starwars.c`: the matrix processor, divider, memory map and I/O
  behavior, from `src/mame/atari/starwars.cpp` and `starwars_m.cpp`
  (copyright Steve Baines and Frank Palazzolo).
* `core/tms5220.c`: the TMS5220 synthesis algorithm from
  `src/devices/sound/tms5220.cpp` (copyright Frank Palazzolo, Aaron Giles,
  Jonathan Gevaryahu, Raphael Nabet, Couriersud, Michael Zapf) and the
  coefficient tables from `src/devices/sound/tms5110r.hxx`.

## POKEY

`core/pokey.c` is an original implementation written for this project. Its
approach, one divide-by-N counter per channel with polynomial noise sampled
from free-running counters, follows the design Ron Fries described for his
1996 POKEY sound emulator, but no code from it is used.

## Hardware drivers

The ST7789 display, QMI8658 IMU and ES8311 codec drivers under `components/`
come from PELLETINO, https://github.com/aedile/PELLETINO, by the same
author, and are covered by this project's 0BSD license.

## libhelix-mp3 (RealNetworks Public Source License)

`components/helix_mp3/` is the fixed-point MP3 decoder from RealNetworks' Helix
project, copyright (c) 1995-2002 RealNetworks, Inc., used for the easter-egg
clips. It is licensed under the RealNetworks Public Source License 1.0 (RPSL),
or alternatively the RealNetworks Community Source License; both are in the
component directory (`RPSL.txt`, `RCSL.txt`, `LICENSE.txt`). The RPSL has
notice and source-availability conditions of its own that apply to that
component; the source is unmodified here.

## TJpgDec (ChaN)

JPEG frames are decoded by the TJpgDec decoder that Espressif ships in the
ESP32-C6 mask ROM (`esp32c6/rom/tjpgd.h`), copyright (C) ChaN, used under its
permissive license: redistribution permitted, provided as is, no warranty.
